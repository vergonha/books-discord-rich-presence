  A clean and modular Swift app that sends reading progress to Discord using IPC and MVVM.

## üìö Discord Rich Presence for Books

This application is a lightweight, native macOS app written in **Swift** that displays your reading activity directly on Discord.
It uses a custom-built **IPC client** to interface with the Discord desktop app and follows the **MVVM** design pattern for separation of concerns and scalability.

You can display book titles, authors, reading progress, and cover art ‚Äî all handled efficiently and with minimal dependencies.

This is my first Swift project. I am currently learning the patterns, syntax, and best practices. I would greatly appreciate any pull requests or issues highlighting areas that could be improved or changed.

## üöÄ Features

- üîå Direct IPC connection to Discord (no 3rd-party wrappers)
- üìñ Dynamic Rich Presence for current book
- üñºÔ∏è Displays title, author, cover image, and progress
- üß† Clean MVVM architecture
- üß© Modular Swift files for transport, errors, and models
- ü™∂ Lightweight and fast (no Electron or heavy UI frameworks)

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Run

### üì¶ Requirements

- macOS Sonoma+
- Swift 5.8+
- Discord Desktop App installed

### üß± Build Steps

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vergonha/books-discord-rich-presence.git
```

- Build and run:

```bash
cd books-discord-rich-presence

swift package resolve
swift build
swift run
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Discord must be open before launching the app. IPC works only with the desktop client.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The app searches the **iBooks database** located in the system‚Äôs **Library folder** to retrieve information about the **last opened book** on the machine. It automatically updates your Discord status with the book‚Äôs title, author, cover image, and reading progress.
